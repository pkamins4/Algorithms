# Algorithms

After graduating I didn't feel like I actually know or understand all the things that university was supposed to teach me so I decided that now, that I have more time, I will once again go over some fundamentals of computer science. In this repository I put some of data structures and algorithms implementations that I learned from book "Introduction to Algorithms, Third edition" by Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest and Clifford Stein.
